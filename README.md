# Biomedical Data Set Analysis: Vertebral Column

## Overview

This project involves analyzing a biomedical data set, originally compiled by Dr. Henrique da Mota during a medical residency in Lyon, France. The data set focuses on the vertebral column and is characterized by biomechanical attributes derived from the pelvis and lumbar spine.

## Data Features

- **Data Source**: The data set is available at [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Vertebral+Column).
- **Attributes**: The data set includes six biomechanical attributes for each patient:

  1. Pelvic Incidence
  2. Pelvic Tilt
  3. Lumbar Lordosis Angle
  4. Sacral Slope
  5. Pelvic Radius
  6. Grade of Spondylolisthesis

- **Class Labels**:

  - DH (Disk Hernia)
  - SL (Spondylolisthesis)
  - NO (Normal)
  - AB (Abnormal)

  For the purpose of this analysis, the focus is on a binary classification task:

  - NO (Normal) as 0
  - AB (Abnormal) as 1

## Project Goal

The primary goal is to utilize this data set to understand the correlation between various biomechanical attributes of the vertebral column and the classification of spinal conditions as Normal or Abnormal.

## Analysis Approach

- Detailed examination of the biomechanical features.
- Application of binary classification techniques to differentiate between Normal (NO) and Abnormal (AB) conditions.

## Importance

This analysis is crucial in the medical field, particularly for understanding spinal conditions and aiding in effective diagnosis and treatment planning based on biomechanical attributes.
